This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
=======
This is an MVP(Minimum Viable Product) Social Media Platform that contains the barebone features of a typical social media platform. The primary objective of this product is to make developers able to quickly build customized social media platforms tailored for their specific clients. As it takes a long time to build large-scale complex web applications like social media from scratch, this product aims to be a good starting point for developers who want a quick digital solution for their clients.
